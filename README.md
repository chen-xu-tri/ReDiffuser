## 1. Download checkpoints

We have uploaded the checkpoints of Diffuser and RND along with the generated dataset used to train RND to the [google drive](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1AjXwI5XOYiyEoXqWiGozLztPjaqIlz7T?usp=sharing). Note that the RND dataset in Maze2D environment is separately stored in the [baidu drive](https://pan.baidu.com/s/1YOn9UH188UKzXrtQy9KKgw?pwd=xn64) with the extraction code as xn64 due to the storage limitation of google drive.

## 2. Run scripts
